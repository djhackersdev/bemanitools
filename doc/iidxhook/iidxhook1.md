# Game list

The following games are compatible with this version of iidxhook:

- 9th Style
- 10th Style
- RED
- HAPPY SKY

The games must be bootstrapped using [inject](../inject.md).

# Data setup and running the game

Ensure your folder with your unpacked data looks like this:

- JAx (Game binary revision folder where 'x' can be A, B, C, D, E, F, G)
- data
- sidcode.txt

Any further files are optional and not required to run the game.

Unpack the package containing iidxhook1 into the revision folder of your choice. Most likely, you
want to target the latest revision you have to run the latest binary of the game with any bugfixes
by developers.

If you don't run this on old hardware that uses an analog version of a Realtek integrated sound
chip, you have to replace RtEffect.dll with a stubbed/patched version (RtEffect_patched.dll).
Otherwise, the game might crash instantly when trying to start it.

Run the appropriate gamestart-XX.bat file as admin, where XX is either 09, 10, 11, 12.

# Configuring iidxhook

The hook library can be configured via cmd arguments or a configuration file. The latter is
generated (*iidxhook.conf* in the same directory) on the first start of the game using the
gamestart-XX.bat file. It contains default values for all available parameters and comments
explaining each parameter. Please follow the comments when configuring your setup.

Add the argument *-h* when running gamestart-XX.bat (e.g. *gamestart-XX.bat -h*) to print help/usage
information with a list of all available parameters. Every parameter can be either set as command
line argument or using a configuration file.

To set a parameter from the command line, just add it as an argument after the bat file like this

```
gamestart-09.bat -p gfx.windowed=true -p gfx.framed=true
```

The syntax for the "key=value" is the same as in the config file. Make sure to have a pre-ceeding
"-p" for every parameter added.

However, if a parameter is specifed in the configuration file and as a command line argument, the
command line argument overrides the config file's value.

# Use d3d8to9 wrapper

In order to use the gfx feature patches, e.g. window mode, monitor check, frame rate locking,
framebuffer up/-downscaling etc. you **must** use the d3d8to9 wrapper library (get it from the
bemanitools-supplement package). Bemanitools removed the old d3d8 hooking module to provide native
d3d8 hooks due to compatibility and maintainability reasons.

# Eamuse network setup

If you want to run the games online, you have to set a valid PCBID in the configuration file or as a
command line argument. You also have to set the url of the eamuse server you want to connect to.

Run the game with the gamestart-XX.bat file and enable network on the operator menu. When enabled,
the game seems to hang and expects you to power cycle the machine (i.e. quit the game and restart
it).

# Switching beat phases 9th and 10th Style

9th Style offers internet ranking phases 1 and 2, 10th Style phases 1, 2 and 3. On both games, the
phases are not controlled by the eamuse server the game is connected to (this started with RED).
Thus, the game was unlocked by binary updates back then. The higher the beat phase, the more expert
courses and songs got unlocked. Furthermore, the "real" ES and OMES are only available on beat#1.
Use the iidx-irbeat-patch-XX.bat to patch to a different beat phase if you want to play on a
different beat phase. The default phase is beat#1. To unlock everything, patch the game to beat#3.
Example: "iidx-irbeat-patch-10.bat 2" to patch to beat#3 on 10th Style

# Real hardware support

## USB IO (ezusb)

Use the specific iidxio API implementations, e.g. iidxio-ezusb.dll to use an old C02 EZUSB IO board,
to run the game on real hardware. Thanks to a common abstraction layer, you can also use more modern
IO, e.g. IO2 boards with iidxio-ezusb2.dll, even with old games that do not support them.

## Slotted/Wave pass card readers

Replace the default *eamio.dll* with the *eamio-icca.dll* and have either your slotted (IIDX, DDR
Supernova or GF/DM type) or new wave pass card readers conencted and and assigned to *COM1*.

### ICCA device settings (device manager)

- Port: COM1
- BAUD rate: 57600
- Data bits: 8
- Parity: None
- Stop bits: 1
- Flow control: None

If you encounter issues after the game opened the device, e.g. application stuck, try a USB \<-> COM
dongle instead of using one of the COM ports of the mainboard.

# Known bugs

## avs00000.bin file on D drive

All other settings data is remapped to the local folders d, e and f. But, for the avs00000.bin file
that's not possible. Once the avs.dll is initialized (DllMain called), it creates that file if it
doesn't exist. Currently, we can't fix this because iidxhook is injected after avs.dll is loaded and
can't be injected before it is loaded to patch the path for the file.

## USBIO (FM-DL TIMEOUT)

IIDX occasionally fails to boot with a "USBIO (FM-DL TIMEOUT)" error. If this happens, run the game
again.

# Troubleshooting and FAQ

## The game is running (very) slow in fullscreen mode but is fine in window mode

If you are using a AMD GPU, try disabling "GPU scaling" which you can find in AMD settings UI under
"Settings" -> "Display".

This issue only observed on 9th Style so far.

Use
[bemanitool's built in upscaling feature](#over-underscan-bad-image-quality-or-latency-caused-by-my-monitorsTV-upscaler)
if the game is not scaled properly in full screen.

## Window mode or any other gfx related options do not work when changing them in the config file or using cmd args

See [this](#Use-d3d8to9-wrapper) section.

## The game does not run "well" (frame drops, drifting offsync etc)

This can be related to various issues:

- Make sure to run the game as (true) Administrator especially on Windows 7 and newer. This will
  also get rid of various other errors (see below) that are related to permission issues.
- Run the game's process with a higher priority:

```
start "" /relatime "gamestart.bat"
```

- Enforce v-sync enabled in your GPU settings.
- Ensure that you have a constant refresh rate around the 60 hz (59.9xx or 60.0xx) that is not
  jumping around. Use the timebase feature of one of the newer games to check that or enable
  iidxhook's timebase and check the log output for the determined value. Run this a few times and
  check if the results differ.
- Use iidxhook's frame rate limiter feature (see further below) to software lock the refresh rate.
  This might be necessary on Windows 7 and newer for D3D8 games, e.g. iidx 9 to 12, which seem to
  ignore GPU side v-sync.
- Use iidxhook's auto timebase feature (see further below) or set a pre-determined value to cut down
  start-up times.

### The game still stutters (randomly) and drifts off-sync

If this concerns a d3d8 based game, i.e. IIDX 9 to 13, use the d3d8to9 wrapper from the
bemanitools-supplement package (follow the included instructions).

## "NETWORK WARNING" instead of "NETWORK OK"

This can be caused by:

- Invalid PCBID
- Firewall blocking connections
- Invalid eamuse url or port specified
- Game is not run using the Administrator account Make sure to check these things first

## My songs are offsync

- Make sure your machine's refresh rate is stable
- If you don't get a close to 59.94hz refresh rate, use the software monitor check/auto timebase
  that's built into iidxhook (refer to help/config file)

## The game crashes instantly (10th, RED, HAPPY SKY)

Replace the original RtEffects.dll with the patched version RtEffects_patched.dll from utils (for
explanation see above).

## The game errors with "PROG CHECKSUM" on boot (10th Style only)

10th Style does some checksum tests on boot that have to be removed in order to boot it with
iidxhook injected. Use a patched executable that removed the checksum tests.

## My game runs too fast

iidxhook can limit the frame rate for you (refer to help/config file)

## My game crashes when I try fullscreen

Use dxwnd and set settings like "Acquire admin caps" and "Fullscreen only"

## 10key input (card reader keyboard) seems unresponsive

10key pad emulation for the old magnetic card readers is quite a mess and can't be refreshed very
often to make it feel unresponsive. Solution: hit your 10key/numpad slower than normal

## Background videos aren't working. When starting a song, windows is playing the error sound and a message box appears (RED, HAPPY SKY)

If you are running in window mode, you can see an error pop-up window with the title
`DirectShow Texture3D Sample` and error message
`Could not create source filter to graph! hr=<some number>`.

When running fullscreen, you only hear a windows error sound and the game appears to be frozen when
trying to play a background video.

You are missing a codec to decode and play the videos. There are different methods available to get
background videos working. Probably, the easiest solution: grab the CLVSD.ax file and go to Start ->
Run -> regsvr32 clvsd.ax Make sure to run cmd.exe as Administrator, otherwise you will get errors
caused by invalid permissions.

## All background videos are looking streched (starting with HAPPY SKY)

The game requires a hardware feature that is not present on newer GPUs. Refer to the help/config
file and turn on the UV fix.

## I installed the CLVSD.ax codec but the game crashes or displays a message box that tells me to disable my debugger

If songs keep crashing upon start and you get an error message that says

```
DirectShow Texture3D Sample
Could not create source filter to graph! hr=0x80040266
```

despite having the codec (CLVSD.ax) installed, turn off debugging output (refer to the help/config
file) or use a CLVSD.ax codec which has the debugger checks removed.

## I used the auto timebase option and/or limited my refresh rate but the songs are still going offsync

There aren't many options left. The old games were developed for specific hardware and are not
guaranteed to work well on (especially) newer hardware. Multiple monitor setups can also have a bad
impact on a stable refresh rate. Try a setup with just a single monitor you want to use for gameplay
physically connected. Furthermore, dedicated and tested/verified hardware by other users is
recommended if you want to save yourself a lot of fiddling.

## Over-/underscan, bad image quality or latency caused by my monitor's/TV's upscaler

Many modern monitors/TVs cannot upscale 640x480 output properly. This can lead to over-/underscan,
bad image quality or even latency caused by the upscaler of the device you are using. If one or
multiple of these issues apply, use the built in scaling options by setting
*gfx.scale_back_buffer_width* and *gfx.scale_back_buffer_height* to a target resolution to scale to.
Usually, you want to set this to the monitor's native resolution, e.g. 1920x1080 for full HD. You
can play around with a few different filters using *gfx.scale_back_buffer_filter* which impacts
image quality/blurriness on upscaling.
