This library drives a "legacy" ezusb IO board, also known as C02/D01 IO, and implements the iidxio
API of BT5. Thus, it allows you to use this IO board with *any* version of IIDX that is supported by
BT5.

# Setup

- Rename iidxio-ezusb.dll to iidxio.dll.
- Ensure that your gamestart.bat actually injects the appropriate iidxhook dll, for example:

```
*inject iidxhook3.dll bm2dx.exe ...*
```

or

```
launcher -K iidxhook4.dll bm2dx.dll ...*
```

- Before running the game, you have to flash a set of binaries to your IO board (base firmware and
  FPGA). The iidxio-ezusb.dll does NOT take care of this and only drives the hardware during
  gameplay. The binary images required are not included with BT5.
- Use the ezusb-tool.exe binary included in the tools sub-package to flash the appropriate ezusb
  base firmware. Once the firmware is flashed successfully, the status LEDs on the side of the board
  should show a blinking pattern.
- Use the ezusb-iidx-fpga-flash.exe binary to flash the appropriate FPGA binary dump to the FPGA.
- There is a script called ezusb-boot.bat which combines the two steps above and can be integrated
  into the startup process of a dedicated setup.
- If you are using a D01 IO board, use the `fpga-d01.bin` file instead of the `fpga.bin` file.
- If you ignore these steps, you will either run into errors or parts of the IO board won't work
  (e.g. lights).
