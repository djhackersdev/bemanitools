This library talks to a MagicBox cab's IO and implements the jbio API of BT5. Thus, it allows you to
use a MagicBox cab with *any* version of jubeat that is supported by BT5.

# Setup

- Rename `jbio-magicbox.dll` to `jbio.dll`.
- Make sure `jbio.dll` is in the same folder as both `jbhook.dll` and `jubeat.dll`
- Make sure that you have a copy of the `ch341dll.dll` that comes with MagicBox.
- Ensure that your `gamestart.bat` actually injects the appropriate jbhook dll for example:

```
launcher -K jbhook.dll jubeat.dll ...*
```

or that the application otherwise uses `jbio.dll`
