# D3D9 Monitor Check

A separate application to run the infamous IIDX “monitor check” without having to run the actual
game.

Simply run the tool without any arguments to get a full synopsis with usage instructions.

Accuracy remarks:

The tool has been tested on an actual cabinet with `nvgpu` setting different custom timings. The
accuracy seems to be even higher than what IIDX’s monitor check is actually showing. For example,
with a custom timing of 59.900, the tool yields 59.902. Meanwhile, the monitor check of iidx 30
yields ~XXX TODO.
