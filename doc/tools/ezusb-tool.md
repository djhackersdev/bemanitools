Tool for fundamental legacy EZUSB management tasks, e.g. scanning for connected devices, querying
basic device info (vid, pid, name) and flashing firmware. This tool requires the "cyusb" driver to
be installed and does NOT work with the "cyusb3" driver and thus not on anything newer than WinXP.

Just run the tool without any arguments to get usage information.
