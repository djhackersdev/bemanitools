Flash a binary FPGA binary (not hex) firmware image to the FPGA of a EZUSB 
board. This assumes that your IO board is already flashed using a base 
firmware image (either by the game itself or using the *ezusb-tool* 
application). Just call the executable and follow the usage instructions. 
The type *v1* refers to the first gen protocol used from iidx 9 to 13 and *v2*
to the second gen protocol used from iidx 14 onwards.
