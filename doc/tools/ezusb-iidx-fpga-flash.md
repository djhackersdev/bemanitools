Flash a binary FPGA binary (not hex) firmware image to the FPGA of a EZUSB board. This assumes that
your IO board is already flashed using a base firmware image (either by the game itself or using the
*ezusb-tool* application). Just call the executable and follow the usage instructions. The type *v1*
refers to the first gen protocol used from iidx 9 to 13 and *v2* to the second gen protocol used
from iidx 14 onwards.
