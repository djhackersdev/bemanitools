A hook library for debugging and dumping usb requests of games that use the ezusb IO board (IIDX
C02, IIDX IO2, Pop'n Music IO2). The library creates a log file *ezusbdbg.log* in the same directory
as your library/executable which contains data dumps of the usb device's traffic.

Example usage: *inject iidxhook1.dll ezusbdbg-hook.dll bm2dx.exe ...* *launcher -K ezusbdbg-hook.dll
bm2dx.dll ...*

Make sure to provide the following additional arguments: *--ezusbdbg_path <device path>* The device
path points to the path to open the device, e.g. on the old IIDX games that was *"\\\\.\\Ezusb-0"*.
If you don't know the path, you can run the hook with dummy data, e.g. *--ezusbdbg_path asdfgqwer*
and check the log for any logged open calls with paths to find your ezusb device.

--ezusbdbg_type \<1 or 2> Specify the type of device to debug. *1* is for the legacy ezusb device,
e.g. IIDX C02, and *2* for the FX2 type device, e.g. IIDX IO2, Pop'n IO2.

Both parameters must be specified, otherwise the hook will error. Make sure to check the logfile for
any errors or warnings as well.
