Tool for fundamental EZUSB FX2 management tasks, e.g. scanning for connected devices, querying basic
device info (vid, pid, name) and flashing firmware. This tool requires the newer "cyusb3" driver and
does NOT work with the old "ezusb" driver.

Just run the tool without any arguments to get usage information.
