## Lose notes

"so theres the twinkle cabs 1st - 8th (863 / C02 upgrade (9th style)
then they made a 10th style cab (D01)
the D01's have a dark front door, the twinkles have a silver door
and it was D01 until 14th (GOLD) which swapped to IO2
and the IO2 cabs are basically identical to D01 except for some wiring differences
tricoro cabs were a bit of a redesign
but wiring was for IO2 and was basically the same"
