# Launcher

Launcher is a tool which is required to run the more recent titles. It sets up
the AVS environment for the target game to boot before it runs the it.

Typically, the tool is run when you use one of the bat script files to start
any of the games that require its usage, e.g. newer IIDX games.

It comes with option switches to configure the AVS environment and for
development, e.g. Halting until a debugger is attached, outputting debug
output to a logfile etc.
Just run the application without any parameters to get a usage message:
```
launcher.exe
```
